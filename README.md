Playing video games is fun but automating the game by writing code is even more fun! 
At least for developers who can not stop programming :grinning:

## How to play
The project uses pure Java without any dependencies for running it. Start by opening the `Main` class.
You can directly start the game by invoking the main method. When the game window is visible press the
return key to start the game! If you win the game the screen will be filled with green color. If you
loose red color will show up. You can always restart the game by pressing the return key on your keyboard.

To safe the princess simply implement an algorithm within the `AutomatedPlayer` class and control
the movements of the hero. 

## Rules
The board
is separated into tiles every action will move the hero by one tile. You can move into any cardinal direction
but be careful not to walk onto a cliff or water tile. There are also enemies which are trying to get you!
So make sure that you hit them first by moving to their tile.

You will win the game when you step onto the tile where the princess is waiting for you.
